The Angular template expression language employs a subset of JavaScript syntax supplemented with a few special operators
for specific scenarios.

## The non-null assertion operator (`!`)

When you use TypeScript's `--strictNullChecks` flag, you can prevent the type checker from throwing an error with Angular's non-null assertion operator, `!`.

The Angular non-null assertion operator causes the TypeScript type checker to suspend strict `null` and `undefined` checks for a specific property expression.

For example, you can assert that `item` properties are also defined.

<code-example header="src/app/app.component.html" path="template-expression-operators/src/app/app.component.html" region="non-null"></code-example>

Often, you want to make sure that any property bindings aren't `null` or `undefined`.
However, there are situations in which such states are acceptable.
For those situations, you can use Angular's non-null assertion operator to prevent TypeScript from reporting that a property is `null` or `undefined`.

The non-null assertion operator, `!`, is optional unless you turn on strict null checks.

For more information, see TypeScript's [strict null checking](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-0.html "Strict null checking in TypeScript").

## The `$any()` type cast function

Sometimes a binding expression triggers a type error during [AOT compilation](guide/aot-compiler) and it is not possible or difficult to fully specify the type.
To silence the error, you can use the `$any()` cast function to cast
the expression to the [`any` type](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html#any) as in the following example:

<code-example header="src/app/app.component.html" path="built-in-template-functions/src/app/app.component.html" region="any-type-cast-function-1"></code-example>

Using `$any()` prevents TypeScript from reporting that `bestByDate` is not a member of the `item` object.

The `$any()` cast function also works with `this` to allow access to undeclared members of the component.

<code-example header="src/app/app.component.html" path="built-in-template-functions/src/app/app.component.html" region="any-type-cast-function-2"></code-example>

The `$any()` cast function works anywhere in a binding expression where a method call is valid.
