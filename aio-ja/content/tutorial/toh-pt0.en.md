# Create a new project

You begin by creating an initial application using the Angular CLI.
Throughout this tutorial, you'll modify and extend that starter application to create the Tour of Heroes application.

In this part of the tutorial, you'll do the following:

1.  Set up your environment.
1.  Create a new workspace and initial application project.
1.  Serve the application.
1.  Make changes to the application.

<div class="alert is-helpful">

For the sample application that this page describes, see the <live-example></live-example>.

</div>

## Set up your environment

To set up your development environment, follow the instructions in [Local Environment Setup](guide/setup-local "Setting up for Local Development").

## Create a new workspace and an initial application

You develop applications in the context of an Angular [workspace](guide/glossary#workspace).
A workspace contains the files for one or more [projects](guide/glossary#project).
A project is the set of files that comprise an application or a library.
For this tutorial, you will create a new workspace.

To create a new workspace and an initial application project:

1.  Ensure that you are not already in an Angular workspace folder.
    For example, if you have previously created the Getting Started workspace, change to the parent of that folder.

1.  Run the CLI command `ng new` and provide the name `angular-tour-of-heroes`, as shown here:

    <code-example format="shell" language="shell">

    ng new angular-tour-of-heroes

    </code-example>

1.  The `ng new` command prompts you for information about features to include in the initial application project.
    Accept the defaults by pressing the Enter or Return key.

The Angular CLI installs the necessary Angular `npm` packages and other dependencies.
This can take a few minutes.

It also creates the following workspace and starter project files:

*   A new workspace, with a root folder named `angular-tour-of-heroes`
*   An initial skeleton app project in the `src/app` subfolder
*   Related configuration files

The initial app project contains a simple Welcome application, ready to run.

## Serve the application

Go to the workspace directory and launch the application.

<code-example format="shell" language="shell">

cd angular-tour-of-heroes
ng serve --open

</code-example>

<div class="alert is-helpful">

The `ng serve` command builds the app, starts the development server,
watches the source files, and rebuilds the application as you make changes to those files.

The `--open` flag opens a browser to `http://localhost:4200`.

</div>

You should see the application running in your browser.

## Angular components

The page you see is the *application shell*.
The shell is controlled by an Angular **component** named `AppComponent`.

*Components* are the fundamental building blocks of Angular applications.
They display data on the screen, listen for user input, and take action based on that input.

## Make changes to the application

Open the project in your favorite editor or IDE and navigate to the `src/app` folder to make some changes to the starter application.

You'll find the implementation of the shell `AppComponent` distributed over three files:

| Files                | Details |
|:---                  |:---     |
| `app.component.ts`   | The component class code, written in TypeScript. |
| `app.component.html` | The component template, written in HTML.         |
| `app.component.css`  | The component's private CSS styles.              |

### Change the application title

Open the component class file \(`app.component.ts`\) and change the value of the `title` property to 'Tour of Heroes'.

<code-example header="app.component.ts (class title property)" path="toh-pt0/src/app/app.component.ts" region="set-title"></code-example>

Open the component template file \(`app.component.html`\) and delete the default template generated by the Angular CLI.
Replace it with the following line of HTML.

<code-example header="app.component.html (template)" path="toh-pt0/src/app/app.component.html"></code-example>

The double curly braces are Angular's *interpolation binding* syntax.
This interpolation binding presents the component's `title` property value inside the HTML header tag.

The browser refreshes and displays the new application title.

<a id="app-wide-styles"></a>

### Add application styles

Most apps strive for a consistent look across the application.
The CLI generated an empty `styles.css` for this purpose.
Put your application-wide styles there.

Open `src/styles.css` and add the code below to the file.

<code-example header="src/styles.css (excerpt)" path="toh-pt0/src/styles.1.css"></code-example>

## Final code review

Here are the code files discussed on this page.

<code-tabs>
    <code-pane header="src/app/app.component.ts" path="toh-pt0/src/app/app.component.ts"></code-pane>
    <code-pane header="src/app/app.component.html" path="toh-pt0/src/app/app.component.html"></code-pane>
    <code-pane header="src/styles.css (excerpt)" path="toh-pt0/src/styles.1.css"></code-pane>
</code-tabs>

## Summary

*   You created the initial application structure using the Angular CLI
*   You learned that Angular components display data
*   You used the double curly braces of interpolation to display the application title
