# Contributing to `events.json`

## About this list

We maintain a list of events (conferences, meetups, etc.) where our team has or will be presenting.
This data is stored in `events.json`.

## How to get an event listed

The `events.json` file is periodically generated from data stored in a Firebase database.
See [here](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/aio/scripts/generate-events/README.md) for more details.

If you want to get an event listed, please get in touch with the Angular DevRel team at [devrel@angular.io](mailto:devrel@angular.io).

> WARNING:
> The `events.json` file is only intended to be updated via a [script](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/aio/scripts/generate-events/index.mjs).
> Do not manually edit the file, because your changes will be overwritten the next time the script runs.
