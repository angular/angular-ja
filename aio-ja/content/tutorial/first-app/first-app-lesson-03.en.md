# Lesson 3: Create the applicationâ€™s HousingLocation component

This tutorial lesson demonstrates how to add the `HousingLocation` component to your Angular app.

**Estimated time**: ~10 minutes

**Starting code:** <live-example name="first-app-lesson-02"></live-example>

**Completed code:** <live-example name="first-app-lesson-03"></live-example>

## What you'll learn
* Your app has a new component: `HousingLocationComponent` and it displays a message confirming that the component was added to your application.

## Step 1 - Create the `HousingLocationComponent`

In this step, you create a new component for your app.

In the **Terminal** pane of your IDE:

1. In your project directory, navigate to the `first-app` directory.

1. Run this command to create a new `HousingLocationComponent`

    <code-example format="shell" language="shell">
    ng generate component housingLocation --standalone --inline-template --skip-tests
    </code-example>

1. Run this command to build and serve your app.

    <code-example format="shell" language="shell">

    ng serve

    </code-example>

1.  Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200` to find the application.
1.  Confirm that the app builds without error.
    <div class="callout is-helpful">
      It should render the same as it did in the previous lesson because even though you added a new component, you haven't included it in any of the app's templates, yet.
    </div>
1.  Leave `ng serve` running as you complete the next steps.

## Step 2 - Add the new component to your app's layout

In this step, you add the new component, `HousingLocationComponent` to your app's `HomeComponent`, so that it displays in your app's layout.

In the **Edit** pane of your IDE:

1.  Open `home.component.ts` in the editor.
1.  In `home.component.ts`, import `HousingLocationComponent` by adding this line to the file level imports.

    <code-example header="Import HousingLocationComponent in src/app/home/home.component.ts" path="first-app-lesson-03/src/app/home/home.component.ts" region="import-housingLocation"></code-example>

1.  Next update the `imports` property of the `@Component` metadata by adding `HousingLocationComponent` to the array.

    <code-example header="Add HousingLocationComponent to imports array in src/app/home/home.component.ts" path="first-app-lesson-03/src/app/home/home.component.ts" region="add-housingLocation-to-array"></code-example>

1.  Now the component is ready for use in the template for the `HomeComponent`. Update the `template` property of the `@Component` metadata to include a reference to the `<app-housing-location>` tag.

    <code-example header="Add housing location to the component template in src/app/home/home.component.ts" path="first-app-lesson-03/src/app/home/home.component.ts" region="add-housingLocation-to-template"></code-example>

## Step 3 - Add the styles for the component

In this step, you will copy over the pre-written styles for the `HousingLocationComponent` to your app so that the app renders properly.

1. Open `src/app/housing-location/housing-location.css`, and paste the styles below into the file:
        
    <code-example header="Add CSS styles to housing location to the component in src/app/housing-location/housing-location.component.css" path="first-app-lesson-03/src/app/housing-location/housing-location.component.css"></code-example>

1.  Save your code, return to the browser and confirm that the app builds without error. You should find the message "housing-location works!" rendered to the screen.Correct any errors before you continue to the next step.

    </section>
