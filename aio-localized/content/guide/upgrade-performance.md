# Upgrading for performance

<div class="alert is-helpful">

  _Angular_ is the name for the Angular of today and tomorrow.<br />
  _AngularJS_ is the name for all 1.x versions of Angular.

</div>

This guide describes some of the built-in tools for efficiently migrating AngularJS projects over to
the Angular platform, one piece at a time. It is very similar to
[Upgrading from AngularJS](guide/upgrade) with the exception that this one uses the {@link
downgradeModule downgradeModule()} helper function instead of the {@link UpgradeModule
UpgradeModule} class. This affects how the application is bootstrapped and how change detection is
propagated between the two frameworks. It allows you to upgrade incrementally while improving the
speed of your hybrid applications and leveraging the latest of Angular in AngularJS applications early in the
process of upgrading.



## Preparation

Before discussing how you can use `downgradeModule()` to create hybrid apps, there are things that
you can do to ease the upgrade process even before you begin upgrading. Because the steps are the
same regardless of how you upgrade, refer to the [Preparation](guide/upgrade#preparation) section of
[Upgrading from AngularJS](guide/upgrade).


## Upgrading with `ngUpgrade`

With the `ngUpgrade` library in Angular you can upgrade an existing AngularJS application incrementally by
building a hybrid app where you can run both frameworks side-by-side. In these hybrid applications you can
mix and match AngularJS and Angular components and services and have them interoperate seamlessly.
That means you don't have to do the upgrade work all at once as there is a natural coexistence
between the two frameworks during the transition period.


### How `ngUpgrade` Works

Regardless of whether you choose `downgradeModule()` or `UpgradeModule`, the basic principles of
upgrading, the mental model behind hybrid apps, and how you use the {@link upgrade/static
upgrade/static} utilities remain the same. For more information, see the
[How `ngUpgrade` Works](guide/upgrade#how-ngupgrade-works) section of
[Upgrading from AngularJS](guide/upgrade).

<div class="alert is-helpful">

  The [Change Detection](guide/upgrade#change-detection) section of
  [Upgrading from AngularJS](guide/upgrade) only applies to applications that use `UpgradeModule`. Though
  you handle change detection differently with `downgradeModule()`, which is the focus of this
  guide, reading the [Change Detection](guide/upgrade#change-detection) section provides helpful
  context for what follows.

</div>


#### Change Detection with `downgradeModule()`

As mentioned before, one of the key differences between `downgradeModule()` and `UpgradeModule` has
to do with change detection and how it is propagated between the two frameworks.

With `UpgradeModule`, the two change detection systems are tied together more tightly. Whenever
something happens in the AngularJS part of the app, change detection is automatically triggered on
the Angular part and vice versa. This is convenient as it ensures that neither framework misses an
important change. Most of the time, though, these extra change detection runs are unnecessary.

`downgradeModule()`, on the other side, avoids explicitly triggering change detection unless it
knows the other part of the application is interested in the changes. For example, if a downgraded component
defines an `@Input()`, chances are that the application needs to be aware when that value changes. Thus,
`downgradeComponent()` automatically triggers change detection on that component.

In most cases, though, the changes made locally in a particular component are of no interest to the
rest of the application. For example, if the user clicks a button that submits a form, the component usually
handles the result of this action. That being said, there _are_ cases where you want to propagate
changes to some other part of the application that may be controlled by the other framework. In such cases,
you are responsible for notifying the interested parties by manually triggering change detection.

If you want a particular piece of code to trigger change detection in the AngularJS part of the app,
you need to wrap it in
[scope.$apply()](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/type/$rootScope.Scope#$apply). Similarly, for
triggering change detection in Angular you would use {@link NgZone#run ngZone.run()}.

In many cases, a few extra change detection runs may not matter much. However, on larger or
change-detection-heavy applications they can have a noticeable impact. By giving you more fine-grained
control over the change detection propagation, `downgradeModule()` allows you to achieve better
performance for your hybrid applications.


## Using `downgradeModule()`

Both AngularJS and Angular have their own concept of modules to help organize an application into cohesive
blocks of functionality.

Their details are quite different in architecture and implementation. In AngularJS, you create a
module by specifying its name and dependencies with
[angular.module()](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/function/angular.module). Then you can add
assets using its various methods. In Angular, you create a class adorned with an {@link NgModule
NgModule} decorator that describes assets in metadata.

In a hybrid application you run both frameworks at the same time. This means that you need at least one
module each from both AngularJS and Angular.

For the most part, you specify the modules in the same way you would for a regular application. Then, you
use the `upgrade/static` helpers to let the two frameworks know about assets they can use from each
other. This is known as "upgrading" and "downgrading".

<div class="alert is-helpful">

  <b>Definitions:</b>

  - _Upgrading_: The act of making an AngularJS asset, such as a component or service, available to
    the Angular part of the application.
  - _Downgrading_: The act of making an Angular asset, such as a component or service, available to
    the AngularJS part of the application.

</div>

An important part of inter-linking dependencies is linking the two main modules together. This is
where `downgradeModule()` comes in. Use it to create an AngularJS module&mdash;one that you can use
as a dependency in your main AngularJS module&mdash;that will bootstrap your main Angular module and
kick off the Angular part of the hybrid application. In a sense, it "downgrades" an Angular module to an
AngularJS module.

There are a few things to note, though:

1. You don't pass the Angular module directly to `downgradeModule()`. All `downgradeModule()` needs
   is a "recipe", for example, a factory function, to create an instance for your module.

2. The Angular module is not instantiated until the application actually needs it.

The following is an example of how you can use `downgradeModule()` to link the two modules.

```ts
// Import `downgradeModule()`.
import { downgradeModule } from '@angular/upgrade/static';

// Use it to downgrade the Angular module to an AngularJS module.
const downgradedModule = downgradeModule(MainAngularModuleFactory);

// Use the downgraded module as a dependency to the main AngularJS module.
angular.module('mainAngularJsModule', [
  downgradedModule
]);
```


#### Specifying a factory for the Angular module

As mentioned earlier, `downgradeModule()` needs to know how to instantiate the Angular module. It
needs a recipe. You define that recipe by providing a factory function that can create an instance
of the Angular module. `downgradeModule()` accepts two types of factory functions:

1. `NgModuleFactory`
2. `(extraProviders: StaticProvider[]) => Promise<NgModuleRef>`

When you pass an `NgModuleFactory`, `downgradeModule()` uses it to instantiate the module using
{@link platformBrowser platformBrowser}'s {@link PlatformRef#bootstrapModuleFactory
bootstrapModuleFactory()}, which is compatible with ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation. AOT compilation
helps make your applications load faster. For more about AOT and how to create an `NgModuleFactory`, see the
[Ahead-of-Time Compilation](guide/aot-compiler) guide.

Alternatively, you can pass a plain function, which is expected to return a promise resolving to an
{@link NgModuleRef NgModuleRef} (that is, an instance of your Angular module). The function is called
with an array of extra {@link StaticProvider Providers} that are expected to be available on the
returned `NgModuleRef`'s {@link Injector Injector}. For example, if you are using {@link
platformBrowser platformBrowser} or {@link platformBrowserDynamic platformBrowserDynamic}, you can
pass the `extraProviders` array to them:

```ts
const bootstrapFn = (extraProviders: StaticProvider[]) => {
  const platformRef = platformBrowserDynamic(extraProviders);
  return platformRef.bootstrapModule(MainAngularModule);
};
// or
const bootstrapFn = (extraProviders: StaticProvider[]) => {
  const platformRef = platformBrowser(extraProviders);
  return platformRef.bootstrapModuleFactory(MainAngularModuleFactory);
};
```

Using an `NgModuleFactory` requires less boilerplate and is a good default option as it supports AOT
out-of-the-box. Using a custom function requires slightly more code, but gives you greater
flexibility.


#### Instantiating the Angular module on-demand

Another key difference between `downgradeModule()` and `UpgradeModule` is that the latter requires
you to instantiate both the AngularJS and Angular modules up-front. This means that you have to pay
the cost of instantiating the Angular part of the app, even if you don't use any Angular assets
until later. `downgradeModule()` is again less aggressive. It will only instantiate the Angular part
when it is required for the first time; that is, as soon as it needs to create a downgraded
component.

You could go a step further and not even download the code for the Angular part of the application to the
user's browser until it is needed. This is especially useful when you use Angular on parts of the
hybrid application that are not necessary for the initial rendering or that the user doesn't reach.


A few examples are:

- You use Angular on specific routes only and you don't need it until/if a user visits such a route.
- You use Angular for features that are only visible to specific types of users; for example,
  logged-in users, administrators, or VIP members. You don't need to load Angular until a user is
  authenticated.
- You use Angular for a feature that is not critical for the initial rendering of the application and you
  can afford a small delay in favor of better initial load performance.


### Bootstrapping with `downgradeModule()`

As you might have guessed, you don't need to change anything in the way you bootstrap your existing
AngularJS application. Unlike `UpgradeModule`&mdash;which requires some extra steps&mdash;
`downgradeModule()` is able to take care of bootstrapping the Angular module, as long as you provide
the recipe.

In order to start using any `upgrade/static` APIs, you still need to load the Angular framework as
you would in a normal Angular application. You can see how this can be done with SystemJS by following the
instructions in the [Upgrade Setup](guide/upgrade-setup "Setup for Upgrading from AngularJS") guide, selectively copying code from the
[QuickStart github repository](https://github.com/angular/quickstart).

You also need to install the `@angular/upgrade` package using `npm install @angular/upgrade --save`
and add a mapping for the `@angular/upgrade/static` package:

<code-example path="upgrade-module/src/systemjs.config.1.js" region="upgrade-static-package" header="systemjs.config.js (map)">
</code-example>

Next, create an `app.module.ts` file and add the following `NgModule` class:

<code-example header="app.module.ts">
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    BrowserModule
  ]
})
export class MainAngularModule {
  // Empty placeholder method to satisfy the `Compiler`.
  ngDoBootstrap() {}
}
</code-example>

This bare minimum `NgModule` imports `BrowserModule`, the module every Angular browser-based app
must have. It also defines an empty `ngDoBootstrap()` method, to prevent the {@link Compiler
Compiler} from returning errors. This is necessary because the module will not have a `bootstrap`
declaration on its `NgModule` decorator.

<div class="alert is-important">

  You do not add a `bootstrap` declaration to the `NgModule` decorator since AngularJS owns the root
  template of the application and `ngUpgrade` bootstraps the necessary components.

</div>

You can now link the AngularJS and Angular modules together using `downgradeModule()`.

<code-example header="app.module.ts">
import { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic';
import { downgradeModule } from '@angular/upgrade/static';

const bootstrapFn = (extraProviders: StaticProvider[]) => {
  const platformRef = platformBrowserDynamic(extraProviders);
  return platformRef.bootstrapModule(MainAngularModule);
};
const downgradedModule = downgradeModule(bootstrapFn);

angular.module('mainAngularJsModule', [
  downgradedModule
]);
</code-example>

The existing AngularJS code works as before _and_ you are ready to start adding Angular code.


### Using Components and Injectables

The differences between `downgradeModule()` and `UpgradeModule` end here. The rest of the
`upgrade/static` APIs and concepts work in the exact same way for both types of hybrid applications.
See [Upgrading from AngularJS](guide/upgrade) to learn about:

- [Using Angular Components from AngularJS Code](guide/upgrade#using-angular-components-from-angularjs-code).<br />
  _NOTE: If you are downgrading multiple modules, you need to specify the name of the downgraded
  module each component belongs to, when calling `downgradeComponent()`._
- [Using AngularJS Component Directives from Angular Code](guide/upgrade#using-angularjs-component-directives-from-angular-code).
- [Projecting AngularJS Content into Angular Components](guide/upgrade#projecting-angularjs-content-into-angular-components).
- [Transcluding Angular Content into AngularJS Component Directives](guide/upgrade#transcluding-angular-content-into-angularjs-component-directives).
- [Making AngularJS Dependencies Injectable to Angular](guide/upgrade#making-angularjs-dependencies-injectable-to-angular).
- [Making Angular Dependencies Injectable to AngularJS](guide/upgrade#making-angular-dependencies-injectable-to-angularjs).<br />
  _NOTE: If you are downgrading multiple modules, you need to specify the name of the downgraded
  module each injectable belongs to, when calling `downgradeInjectable()`._

<div class="alert is-important">

  While it is possible to downgrade injectables, downgraded injectables will not be available until
  the Angular module that provides them is instantiated. In order to be safe, you need to ensure
  that the downgraded injectables are not used anywhere _outside_ the part of the application where it is
  guaranteed that their module has been instantiated.

  For example, it is _OK_ to use a downgraded service in an upgraded component that is only used
  from a downgraded Angular component provided by the same Angular module as the injectable, but it
  is _not OK_ to use it in an AngularJS component that may be used independently of Angular or use
  it in a downgraded Angular component from a different module.

</div>


## Using ahead-of-time compilation with hybrid apps

You can take advantage of ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation in hybrid applications just like in any other
Angular application. The setup for a hybrid application is mostly the same as described in the
[Ahead-of-Time Compilation](guide/aot-compiler) guide save for differences in `index.html` and
`main-aot.ts`.

AOT needs to load any AngularJS files that are in the `<script>` tags in the AngularJS `index.html`.
An easy way to copy them is to add each to the `copy-dist-files.js` file.

You also need to pass the generated `MainAngularModuleFactory` to `downgradeModule()` instead of the
custom bootstrap function:

<code-example header="app/main-aot.ts">
import { downgradeModule } from '@angular/upgrade/static';
import { MainAngularModuleNgFactory } from '../aot/app/app.module.ngfactory';

const downgradedModule = downgradeModule(MainAngularModuleNgFactory);

angular.module('mainAngularJsModule', [
  downgradedModule
]);
</code-example>

And that is all you need to do to get the full benefit of AOT for hybrid Angular applications.


## Conclusion

This page covered how to use the {@link upgrade/static upgrade/static} package to incrementally
upgrade existing AngularJS applications at your own pace and without impeding further development of the app
for the duration of the upgrade process.

Specifically, this guide showed how you can achieve better performance and greater flexibility in
your hybrid applications by using {@link downgradeModule downgradeModule()} instead of {@link UpgradeModule
UpgradeModule}.

To summarize, the key differentiating factors of `downgradeModule()` are:

1. It allows instantiating or even loading the Angular part lazily, which improves the initial
   loading time. In some cases this may waive the cost of running a second framework altogether.
2. It improves performance by avoiding unnecessary change detection runs while giving the developer
   greater ability to customize.
3. It does not require you to change how you bootstrap your AngularJS application.

Using `downgradeModule()` is a good option for hybrid applications when you want to keep the AngularJS and
Angular parts less coupled. You can still mix and match components and services from both
frameworks, but you might need to manually propagate change detection. In return,
`downgradeModule()` offers more control and better performance.
