# Set the runtime locale

The initial installation of Angular already contains locale data for English in the United States \(`en-US`\).
The [Angular CLI][AioCliMain] automatically includes the locale data and sets the `LOCALE_ID` value when you use the `--localize` option with [`ng build`][AioCliBuild] command.


[AioApiCoreLocaleId]: api/core/LOCALE_ID "LOCALE_ID | Core - API | Angular"

[AioCliMain]: cli "CLI Overview and Command Reference | Angular"
[AioCliBuild]: cli/build "ng build | CLI | Angular"
