## Before you start

Like most modern frameworks, Angular expects you to be familiar with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. If you are totally new to frontend development, it might not be the best idea to jump right into a framework as your first step. Grasp the basics and then come back! Prior experience with other frameworks helps, but is not required.

In addition, you should be familiar with the following concepts:

- [JavaScript Classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)
- [TypeScript fundamentals](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html)
- [TypeScript Decorators](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/decorators.html)
