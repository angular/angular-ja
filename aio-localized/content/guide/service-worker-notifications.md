# Service worker notifications

Push notifications are a compelling way to engage users. Through the power of service workers, notifications can be delivered to a device even when your application is not in focus.

The Angular service worker enables the display of push notifications and the handling of notification click events.

<div class="alert is-helpful">

  When using the Angular service worker, push notification interactions are handled using the `SwPush` service.
  To learn more about the browser APIs involved see [Push API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Push_API) and [Using the Notifications API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Notifications_API/Using_the_Notifications_API).

#### Prerequisites

We recommend you have a basic understanding of the following:

- [Getting Started with Service Workers](guide/service-worker-getting-started).

## Notification payload

Invoke push notifications by pushing a message with a valid payload. See `SwPush` for guidance.

<div class="alert is-helpful">

  In Chrome, you can test push notifications without a backend.
  Open Devtools -> Application -> Service Workers and use the `Push` input to send a JSON notification payload.

</div>

## Notification click handling

The default behavior for the `notificationclick` event is to close the notification and notify `SwPush.notificationClicks`.

You can specify an additional operation to be executed on `notificationclick` by adding an `onActionClick` property to the `data` object, and providing a `default` entry. This is especially useful for when there are no open clients when a notification is clicked.

```json
{
  "notification": {
    "title": "New Notification!",
    "data": {
      "onActionClick": {
        "default": {"operation": "openWindow", "url": "foo"}
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Operations

The Angular service worker supports the following operations:

- `openWindow`: Opens a new tab at the specified URL, which is resolved relative to the service worker scope.

- `focusLastFocusedOrOpen`: Focuses the last focused client. If there is no client open, then it opens a new tab at the specified URL, which is resolved relative to the service worker scope.

- `navigateLastFocusedOrOpen`: Focuses the last focused client and navigates it to the specified URL, which is resolved relative to the service worker scope. If there is no client open, then it opens a new tab at the specified URL.

<div class="alert is-important">

  If an `onActionClick` item does not define a `url`, then the service worker's registration scope is used.
  
</div>

### Actions

Actions offer a way to customize how the user can interact with a notification.

Using the `actions` property, you can define a set of available actions. Each action is represented as an action button that the user can click to interact with the notification.

In addition, using the `onActionClick` property on the `data` object, you can tie each action to an operation to be performed when the corresponding action button is clicked:

```ts
{
  "notification": {
    "title": "New Notification!",
    "actions": [
      {"action": "foo", "title": "Open new tab"},
      {"action": "bar", "title": "Focus last"},
      {"action": "baz", "title": "Navigate last"},
      {"action": "qux", "title": "Just notify existing clients"}
    ],
    "data": {
      "onActionClick": {
        "default": {"operation": "openWindow"},
        "foo": {"operation": "openWindow", "url": "/absolute/path"},
        "bar": {"operation": "focusLastFocusedOrOpen", "url": "relative/path"},
        "baz": {"operation": "navigateLastFocusedOrOpen", "url": "https://other.domain.com/"}
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<div class="alert is-important">

  If an action does not have a corresponding `onActionClick` entry, then the notification is closed and `SwPush.notificationClicks` is notified on existing clients.

</div>
