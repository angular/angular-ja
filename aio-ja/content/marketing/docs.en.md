## Assumptions


These docs assume that you are already familiar with [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML "Learn HTML"), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps "Learn CSS"), [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript "Learn JavaScript"),
and some of the tools from the [latest standards](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Language_Resources "Latest JavaScript standards"), such as [classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes "ES2015 Classes") and [modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import "ES2015 Modules").
The code samples are written using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/ "TypeScript").
Most Angular code can be written with just the latest JavaScript, using [types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/classes.html "TypeScript Types") for dependency injection, and using [decorators](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/decorators.html "Decorators") for metadata.
