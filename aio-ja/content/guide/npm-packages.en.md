# Workspace npm dependencies

The Angular Framework, Angular CLI, and components used by Angular applications are packaged as [npm packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm "What is npm?") and distributed using the [npm registry](https://docs.npmjs.com).

You can download and install these npm packages by using the [npm CLI client](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install), which is installed with and runs as a [Node.jsÂ®](https://nodejs.org "Nodejs.org") application.
By default, the Angular CLI uses the npm client.

Alternatively, you can use the [yarn client](https://yarnpkg.com) for downloading and installing npm packages.

<div class="alert is-helpful">

See [Local Environment Setup](guide/setup-local "Setting up for Local Development") for information about the required versions and installation of `Node.js` and `npm`.

If you already have projects running on your machine that use other versions of Node.js and npm, consider using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to manage the multiple versions of Node.js and npm.

</div>

## `package.json`

Both `npm` and `yarn` install the packages that are identified in a [`package.json`](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json) file.

The CLI command `ng new` creates a `package.json` file when it creates the new workspace.
This `package.json` is used by all projects in the workspace, including the initial application project that is created by the CLI when it creates the workspace.

Initially, this `package.json` includes *a starter set of packages*, some of which are required by Angular and others that support common application scenarios.
You add packages to `package.json` as your application evolves.
You may even remove some.

The `package.json` is organized into two groups of packages:

| Packages                                               | Details |
|:---                                                    |:---     |
| [Dependencies](guide/npm-packages#dependencies)        | Essential to *running* applications.      |
| [DevDependencies](guide/npm-packages#dev-dependencies) | Only necessary to *develop* applications. |

<div class="alert is-helpful">

**LIBRARY DEVELOPERS**: <br />
By default, the CLI command [`ng generate library`](cli/generate) creates a `package.json` for the new library.
That `package.json` is used when publishing the library to npm.
For more information, see the CLI wiki page [Library Support](guide/creating-libraries).

## Dependencies

The packages listed in the `dependencies` section of `package.json` are essential to *running* applications.

The `dependencies` section of `package.json` contains:

| Packages                              | Details |
|:---                                   |:---     |
| [Angular packages](#angular-packages) | Angular core and optional modules; their package names begin `@angular`  |
| [Support packages](#support-packages) | 3rd party libraries that must be present for Angular applications to run |
| [Polyfill packages](#polyfills)       | Polyfills plug gaps in a browser's JavaScript implementation             |

To add a new dependency, use the [`ng add`](cli/add) command.

### Angular packages

The following Angular packages are included as dependencies in the default `package.json` file for a new Angular workspace.
For a complete list of Angular packages, see the [API reference](api?type=package).

| Package name                                                        | Details |
|:---                                                                 |:---     |
| [`@angular/animations`](api/animations)                             | Angular's animations library makes it easy to define and apply animation effects such as page and list transitions. For more information, see the [Animations guide](guide/animations).                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [`@angular/common`](api/common)                                     | The commonly-needed services, pipes, and directives provided by the Angular team. The [`HttpClientModule`](api/common/http/HttpClientModule) is also here, in the [`@angular/common/http`](api/common/http) subfolder. For more information, see the [HttpClient guide](guide/http).                                                                                          |
| `@angular/compiler`                                                 | Angular's template compiler. It understands templates and can convert them to code that makes the application run and render. Typically you don't interact with the compiler directly; rather, you use it indirectly using `platform-browser-dynamic` when JIT compiling in the browser. For more information, see the [Ahead-of-time Compilation guide](guide/aot-compiler). |
| [`@angular/core`](api/core)                                         | Critical runtime parts of the framework that are needed by every application. Includes all metadata decorators, `Component`, `Directive`,  dependency injection, and the component lifecycle hooks.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [`@angular/forms`](api/forms)                                       | Support for both [template-driven](guide/forms) and [reactive forms](guide/reactive-forms). For information about choosing the best forms approach for your app, see [Introduction to forms](guide/forms-overview).                                                                                                                                                           |
| [`@angular/platform-browser`](api/platform-browser)                 | Everything DOM and browser related, especially the pieces that help render into the DOM. This package also includes the `bootstrapModuleFactory()` method for bootstrapping applications for production builds that pre-compile with [AOT](guide/aot-compiler).                                                                                                               |
| [`@angular/platform-browser-dynamic`](api/platform-browser-dynamic) | Includes [providers](api/core/Provider) and methods to compile and run the application on the client using the [JIT compiler](guide/aot-compiler).                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [`@angular/router`](api/router)                                     | The router module navigates among your application pages when the browser URL changes. For more information, see [Routing and Navigation](guide/router).                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

### Support packages

The following support packages are included as dependencies in the default `package.json` file for a new Angular workspace.

| Package name                                    | Details |
|:---                                             |:---     |
| [`rxjs`](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs)     | Many Angular APIs return [*observables*](guide/glossary#observable). RxJS is an implementation of the proposed [Observables specification](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-observable) currently before the [TC39](https://www.ecma-international.org/memento/tc39.htm) committee, which determines standards for the JavaScript language.                                     |
| [`zone.js`](https://github.com/angular/zone.js) | Angular relies on zone.js to run Angular's change detection processes when native JavaScript operations raise events. Zone.js is an implementation of a [specification](https://gist.github.com/mhevery/63fdcdf7c65886051d55) currently before the [TC39](https://www.ecma-international.org/memento/tc39.htm) committee that determines standards for the JavaScript language. |

<a id="polyfills"></a>

### Polyfill packages

Many browsers lack native support for some features in the latest HTML standards, features that Angular requires.
[*Polyfills*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyfill_(programming)) can emulate the missing features.
The [Browser Support](guide/browser-support) guide explains which browsers need polyfills and how you can add them.

<a id="dev-dependencies"></a>

## DevDependencies

The packages listed in the `devDependencies` section of `package.json` help you develop the application on your local machine.
You don't deploy them with the production application.

To add a new `devDependency`, use either one of the following commands:

<code-example format="shell" language="shell">

npm install --save-dev &lt;package-name&gt;

</code-example>

<code-example format="shell" language="shell">

yarn add --dev &lt;package-name&gt;

</code-example>

The following `devDependencies` are provided in the default `package.json` file for a new Angular workspace.
