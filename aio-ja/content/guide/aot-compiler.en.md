# The Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compiler

The Angular Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compiler converts your Angular HTML and TypeScript code into efficient JavaScript code during the build phase _before_ the browser downloads and runs that code.

This guide explains how to build with the AOT compiler and how to write Angular metadata that AOT can compile.

{@a overview}

## Angular compilation

An Angular application consists largely of components and their HTML templates.
Before the browser can render the application,
the components and templates must be converted to executable JavaScript by an _Angular compiler_.

Angular offers two ways to compile your application:

1. **_Just-in-Time_ (JIT)**, which compiles your app in the browser at runtime
1. **_Ahead-of-Time_ (AOT)**, which compiles your app at build time.

JIT compilation is the default when you run the _build-only_ or the _build-and-serve-locally_ CLI commands:

<code-example language="sh" class="code-shell">
  ng build
  ng serve
</code-example>

{@a compile}

For AOT compilation, append the `--aot` flags to the _build-only_ or the _build-and-serve-locally_ CLI commands:

<code-example language="sh" class="code-shell">
  ng build --aot
  ng serve --aot
</code-example>

<div class="l-sub-section">

The `--prod` meta-flag compiles with AOT by default.

See the [CLI documentation](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki) for details, especially the [`build` topic](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/build).

{@a why-aot}

## Why compile with AOT?

*Faster rendering*

With AOT, the browser downloads a pre-compiled version of the application.
The browser loads executable code so it can render the application immediately, without waiting to compile the app first.

*Fewer asynchronous requests*

The compiler _inlines_ external HTML templates and CSS style sheets within the application JavaScript,
eliminating separate ajax requests for those source files.

*Smaller Angular framework download size*

There's no need to download the Angular compiler if the app is already compiled.
The compiler is roughly half of Angular itself, so omitting it dramatically reduces the application payload.

*Detect template errors earlier*

The AOT compiler detects and reports template binding errors during the build step
before users can see them.

*Better security*

AOT compiles HTML templates and components into JavaScript files long before they are served to the client.
With no templates to read and no risky client-side HTML or JavaScript evaluation,
there are fewer opportunities for injection attacks.

## Angular Metadata and AOT

The Angular **AOT compiler** extracts and interprets **metadata** about the parts of the application that Angular is supposed to manage.

Angular metadata tells Angular how to construct instances of your application classes and interact with them at runtime.

You specify the metadata with **decorators** such as `@Component()` and `@Input()`.
You also specify metadata implicitly in the constructor declarations of these decorated classes.

In the following example, the `@Component()` metadata object and the class constructor tell Angular how to create and display an instance of `TypicalComponent`.

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-typical',
  template: '<div>A typical component for {{data.name}}</div>'
)}
export class TypicalComponent {
  @Input() data: TypicalData;
  constructor(private someService: SomeService) { ... }
}
```

The Angular compiler extracts the metadata _once_ and generates a _factory_ for `TypicalComponent`.
When it needs to create a `TypicalComponent` instance, Angular calls the factory, which produces a new visual element, bound to a new instance of the component class with its injected dependency.

## Metadata restrictions

You write metadata in a _subset_ of TypeScript that must conform to the following general constraints:

1. Limit [expression syntax](#expression-syntax) to the supported subset of JavaScript.
2. Only reference exported symbols after [code folding](#folding).
3. Only call [functions supported](#supported-functions) by the compiler.
4. Decorated and data-bound class members must be public.

The next sections elaborate on these points.

## How AOT works

It helps to think of the AOT compiler as having two phases: a code analysis phase in which it simply records a representation of the source; and a code generation phase in which the compiler's `StaticReflector` handles the interpretation as well as places restrictions on what it interprets.

## Phase 1: analysis

The TypeScript compiler does some of the analytic work of the first phase. It emits the `.d.ts` _type definition files_ with type information that the AOT compiler needs to generate application code.

At the same time, the AOT **_collector_** analyzes the metadata recorded in the Angular decorators and outputs metadata information in **`.metadata.json`** files, one per `.d.ts` file.

You can think of `.metadata.json` as a diagram of the overall structure of a decorator's metadata, represented as an [abstract syntax tree (AST)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree).

<div class="l-sub-section">

Angular's [schema.ts](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/compiler-cli/src/metadata/schema.ts)
describes the JSON format as a collection of TypeScript interfaces.

</div>

{@a expression-syntax}
### Expression syntax

The _collector_ only understands a subset of JavaScript.
Define metadata objects with the following limited syntax:

Syntax                             | Example
-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------
Literal object                     | `{cherry: true, apple: true, mincemeat: false}`
Literal array                      | `['cherries', 'flour', 'sugar']`
Spread in literal array            | `['apples', 'flour', ...the_rest]`
Calls                              | `bake(ingredients)`
New                                | `new Oven()`
Property access                    | `pie.slice`
Array index                        | `ingredients[0]`
Identifier reference               | `Component`
A template string                  | <code>&#96;pie is ${multiplier} times better than cake&#96;</code>
Literal string                     | `'pi'`
Literal number                     | `3.14153265`
Literal boolean                    | `true`
Literal null                       | `null`
Supported prefix operator          | `!cake`
Supported Binary operator          | `a + b`
Conditional operator               | `a ? b : c`
Parentheses                        | `(a + b)`

If an expression uses unsupported syntax, the _collector_ writes an error node to the `.metadata.json` file. The compiler later reports the error if it needs that
piece of metadata to generate the application code.

<div class="l-sub-section">

 If you want `ngc` to report syntax errors immediately rather than produce a `.metadata.json` file with errors, set the `strictMetadataEmit` option in `tsconfig`.

```
  "angularCompilerOptions": {
   ...
   "strictMetadataEmit" : true
 }
 ```

Angular libraries have this option to ensure that all Angular `.metadata.json` files are clean and it is a best practice to do the same when building your own libraries.

</div>

{@a function-expression}
{@a arrow-functions}
### No arrow functions

The AOT compiler does not support [function expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/function)
and [arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions), also called _lambda_ functions.

Consider the following component decorator:

```ts
@Component({
  ...
  providers: [{provide: server, useFactory: () => new Server()}]
})
```

The AOT _collector_ does not support the arrow function, `() => new Server()`, in a metadata expression.
It generates an error node in place of the function.

When the compiler later interprets this node, it reports an error that invites you to turn the arrow function into an _exported function_.

You can fix the error by converting to this:

```ts
export function serverFactory() {
  return new Server();
}

@Component({
  ...
  providers: [{provide: server, useFactory: serverFactory}]
})
```

Beginning in version 5, the compiler automatically performs this rewritting while emitting the `.js` file.

### Limited function calls

The _collector_ can represent a function call or object creation with `new` as long as the syntax is valid. The _collector_ only cares about proper syntax.

But beware. The compiler may later refuse to generate a call to a _particular_ function or creation of a _particular_ object.
The compiler only supports calls to a small set of functions and will use `new` for only a few designated classes. These functions and classes are in a table of [below](#supported-functions).


### Folding
{@a exported-symbols}
The compiler can only resolve references to **_exported_** symbols.
Fortunately, the _collector_ enables limited use of non-exported symbols through _folding_.

The _collector_ may be able to evaluate an expression during collection and record the result in the `.metadata.json` instead of the original expression.

For example, the _collector_ can evaluate the expression `1 + 2 + 3 + 4` and replace it with the result, `10`.

This process is called _folding_. An expression that can be reduced in this manner is _foldable_.

{@a var-declaration}
The collector can evaluate references to
module-local `const` declarations and initialized `var` and `let` declarations, effectively removing them from the `.metadata.json` file.

Consider the following component definition:

```ts
const template = '<div>{{hero.name}}</div>';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-hero',
  template: template
})
export class HeroComponent {
  @Input() hero: Hero;
}
```

The compiler could not refer to the `template` constant because it isn't exported.

But the _collector_ can _fold_ the `template` constant into the metadata definition by inlining its contents.
The effect is the same as if you had written:

```TypeScript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-hero',
  template: '<div>{{hero.name}}</div>'
})
export class HeroComponent {
  @Input() hero: Hero;
}
```

There is no longer a reference to `template` and, therefore, nothing to trouble the compiler when it later interprets the _collector's_ output in `.metadata.json`.

You can take this example a step further by including the `template` constant in another expression:

```TypeScript
const template = '<div>{{hero.name}}</div>';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-hero',
  template: template + '<div>{{hero.title}}</div>'
})
export class HeroComponent {
  @Input() hero: Hero;
}
```

The _collector_ reduces this expression to its equivalent _folded_ string:

`'<div>{{hero.name}}</div><div>{{hero.title}}</div>'`.

#### Foldable syntax

The following table describes which expressions the _collector_ can and cannot fold:

Syntax                             | Foldable
-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------
Literal object                     | yes
Literal array                      | yes
Spread in literal array            | no
Calls                              | no
New                                | no
Property access                    | yes, if target is foldable
Array index                        | yes, if target and index are foldable
Identifier reference               | yes, if it is a reference to a local
A template with no substitutions   | yes
A template with substitutions      | yes, if the substitutions are foldable
Literal string                     | yes
Literal number                     | yes
Literal boolean                    | yes
Literal null                       | yes
Supported prefix operator          | yes, if operand is foldable
Supported binary operator          | yes, if both left and right are foldable
Conditional operator               | yes, if condition is foldable
Parentheses                        | yes, if the expression is foldable

If an expression is not foldable, the collector writes it to `.metadata.json` as an [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) for the compiler to resolve.


## Phase 2: code generation

The _collector_ makes no attempt to understand the metadata that it collects and outputs to `.metadata.json`. It represents the metadata as best it can and records errors when it detects a metadata syntax violation.

It's the compiler's job to interpret the `.metadata.json` in the code generation phase.

The compiler understands all syntax forms that the _collector_ supports, but it may reject _syntactically_ correct metadata if the _semantics_ violate compiler rules.

The compiler can only reference _exported symbols_.

Decorated component class members must be public. You cannot make an `@Input()` property private or internal.

Data bound properties must also be public.

```TypeScript
// BAD CODE - title is private
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  template: '<h1>{{title}}</h1>'
})
export class AppComponent {
  private title = 'My App'; // Bad
}
```

{@a supported-functions}
Most importantly, the compiler only generates code to create instances of certain classes, support certain decorators, and call certain functions from the following lists.


### New instances

The compiler only allows metadata that create instances of the class `InjectionToken` from `@angular/core`.

### Annotations/Decorators

The compiler only supports metadata for these Angular decorators.

Decorator         | Module
------------------|--------------
`Attribute`       | `@angular/core`
`Component`       | `@angular/core`
`ContentChild`    | `@angular/core`
`ContentChildren` | `@angular/core`
`Directive`       | `@angular/core`
`Host`            | `@angular/core`
`HostBinding`     | `@angular/core`
`HostListener`    | `@angular/core`
`Inject`          | `@angular/core`
`Injectable`      | `@angular/core`
`Input`           | `@angular/core`
`NgModule`        | `@angular/core`
`Optional`        | `@angular/core`
`Output`          | `@angular/core`
`Pipe`            | `@angular/core`
`Self`            | `@angular/core`
`SkipSelf`        | `@angular/core`
`ViewChild`       | `@angular/core`


### Macro-functions and macro-static methods

The compiler also supports _macros_ in the form of functions or static
methods that return an expression.

For example, consider the following function:

```TypeScript
export function wrapInArray<T>(value: T): T[] {
  return [value];
}
```

You can call the `wrapInArray` in a metadata definition because it returns the value of an expression that conforms to the compiler's restrictive JavaScript subset.

You might use  `wrapInArray()` like this:

```TypeScript
@NgModule({
  declarations: wrapInArray(TypicalComponent)
})
export class TypicalModule {}
```

The compiler treats this usage as if you had written:

```TypeScript
@NgModule({
  declarations: [TypicalComponent]
})
export class TypicalModule {}
```

The collector is simplistic in its determination of what qualifies as a macro
function; it can only contain a single `return` statement.

The Angular [`RouterModule`](api/router/RouterModule) exports two macro static methods, `forRoot` and `forChild`, to help declare root and child routes.
Review the [source code](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/router/src/router_module.ts#L139 "RouterModule.forRoot source code")
for these methods to see how macros can simplify configuration of complex [NgModules](guide/ngmodule).

### Metadata rewriting

The compiler treats object literals containing the fields `useClass`, `useValue`, `useFactory`, and `data` specially. The compiler converts the expression initializing one of these fields into an exported variable, which replaces the expression. This process of rewriting these expressions removes all the restrictions on what can be in them because
the compiler doesn't need to know the expression's value&mdash;it just needs to be able to generate a reference to the value.



You might write something like:

```ts
class TypicalServer {

}

@NgModule({
  providers: [{provide: SERVER, useFactory: () => TypicalServer}]
})
export class TypicalModule {}
```

Without rewriting, this would be invalid because lambdas are not supported and `TypicalServer` is not exported.

To allow this, the compiler automatically rewrites this to something like:

```ts
class TypicalServer {

}

export const ɵ0 = () => new TypicalServer();

@NgModule({
  providers: [{provide: SERVER, useFactory: ɵ0}]
})
export class TypicalModule {}
```

This allows the compiler to generate a reference to `ɵ0` in the
factory without having to know what the value of `ɵ0` contains.

The compiler does the rewriting during the emit of the `.js` file. This doesn't rewrite the `.d.ts` file, however, so TypeScript doesn't recognize it as being an export. Thus, it does not pollute the ES module's exported API.


## Metadata Errors

The following are metadata errors you may encounter, with explanations and suggested corrections.

[Expression form not supported](#expression-form-not-supported)<br>
[Reference to a local (non-exported) symbol](#reference-to-a-local-symbol)<br>
[Only initialized variables and constants](#only-initialized-variables)<br>
[Reference to a non-exported class](#reference-to-a-non-exported-class)<br>
[Reference to a non-exported function](#reference-to-a-non-exported-function)<br>
[Function calls are not supported](#function-calls-not-supported)<br>
[Destructured variable or constant not supported](#destructured-variable-not-supported)<br>
[Could not resolve type](#could-not-resolve-type)<br>
[Name expected](#name-expected)<br>
[Unsupported enum member name](#unsupported-enum-member-name)<br>
[Tagged template expressions are not supported](#tagged-template-expressions-not-supported)<br>
[Symbol reference expected](#symbol-reference-expected)<br>

<hr>

<h3 class="no-toc">Expression form not supported</h3>

The compiler encountered an expression it didn't understand while evalutating Angular metadata.

Language features outside of the compiler's [restricted expression syntax](#expression-syntax)
can produce this error, as seen in the following example:

```
// ERROR
export class Fooish { ... }
...
const prop = typeof Fooish; // typeof is not valid in metadata
  ...
  // bracket notation is not valid in metadata
  { provide: 'token', useValue: { [prop]: 'value' } };
  ...
```

You can use `typeof` and bracket notation in normal application code.
You just can't use those features within expressions that define Angular metadata.

Avoid this error by sticking to the compiler's [restricted expression syntax](#expression-syntax)
when writing Angular metadata
and be wary of new or unusual TypeScript features.

<hr>

{@a reference-to-a-local-symbol}
<h3 class="no-toc">Reference to a local (non-exported) symbol</h3>

<div class="alert is-helpful">

_Reference to a local (non-exported) symbol 'symbol name'. Consider exporting the symbol._

</div>

The compiler encountered a referenced to a locally defined symbol that either wasn't exported or wasn't initialized.

Here's a `provider` example of the problem.

```
// ERROR
let foo: number; // neither exported nor initialized

@Component({
  selector: 'my-component',
  template: ... ,
  providers: [
    { provide: Foo, useValue: foo }
  ]
})
export class MyComponent {}
```
The compiler generates the component factory, which includes the `useValue` provider code, in a separate module. _That_ factory module can't reach back to _this_ source module to access the local (non-exported) `foo` variable.

You could fix the problem by initializing `foo`.

```
let foo = 42; // initialized
```

The compiler will [fold](#folding) the expression into the provider as if you had written this.

```
  providers: [
    { provide: Foo, useValue: 42 }
  ]
```

Alternatively, you can fix it by exporting `foo` with the expectation that `foo` will be assigned at runtime when you actually know its value.

```
// CORRECTED
export let foo: number; // exported

@Component({
  selector: 'my-component',
  template: ... ,
  providers: [
    { provide: Foo, useValue: foo }
  ]
})
export class MyComponent {}
```

Adding `export` often works for variables referenced in metadata such as `providers` and `animations` because the compiler can generate _references_ to the exported variables in these expressions. It doesn't need the _values_ of those variables.

Adding `export` doesn't work when the compiler needs the _actual value_
in order to generate code.
For example, it doesn't work for the `template` property.

```
// ERROR
export let someTemplate: string; // exported but not initialized

@Component({
  selector: 'my-component',
  template: someTemplate
})
export class MyComponent {}
```

The compiler needs the value of the `template` property _right now_ to generate the component factory.
The variable reference alone is insufficient.
Prefixing the declaration with `export` merely produces a new error, "[`Only initialized variables and constants can be referenced`](#only-initialized-variables)".

<hr>

{@a only-initialized-variables}
<h3 class="no-toc">Only initialized variables and constants</h3>

<div class="alert is-helpful">

_Only initialized variables and constants can be referenced because the value of this variable is needed by the template compiler._

</div>

The compiler found a reference to an exported variable or static field that wasn't initialized.
It needs the value of that variable to generate code.

The following example tries to set the component's `template` property to the value of
the exported `someTemplate` variable which is declared but _unassigned_.

```
// ERROR
export let someTemplate: string;

@Component({
  selector: 'my-component',
  template: someTemplate
})
export class MyComponent {}
```

You'd also get this error if you imported `someTemplate` from some other module and neglected to initialize it there.

```
// ERROR - not initialized there either
import { someTemplate } from './config';

@Component({
  selector: 'my-component',
  template: someTemplate
})
export class MyComponent {}
```

The compiler cannot wait until runtime to get the template information.
It must statically derive the value of the `someTemplate` variable from the source code
so that it can generate the component factory, which includes
instructions for building the element based on the template.

To correct this error, provide the initial value of the variable in an initializer clause _on the same line_.

```
// CORRECTED
export let someTemplate = '<h1>Greetings from Angular</h1>';

@Component({
  selector: 'my-component',
  template: someTemplate
})
export class MyComponent {}
```

<hr>

<h3 class="no-toc">Reference to a non-exported class</h3>

<div class="alert is-helpful">

```
// ERROR

<div class="alert is-helpful">

_Function calls are not supported. Consider replacing the function or lambda with a reference to an exported function._

The compiler does not currently support [function expressions or lambda functions](#function-expression).
For example, you cannot set a provider's `useFactory` to an anonymous function or arrow function like this.

```
// ERROR

<hr>

<h3 class="no-toc">Could not resolve type</h3>

The compiler encountered a type and can't determine which module exports that type.

This can happen if you refer to an ambient type.
For example, the `Window` type is an ambiant type declared in the global `.d.ts` file.

You'll get an error if you reference it in the component constructor,
which the compiler must statically analyze.

```
// ERROR
@Component({ })
export class MyComponent {
  constructor (private win: Window) { ... }
}
```
TypeScript understands ambiant types so you don't import them.
The Angular compiler does not understand a type that you neglect to export or import.

In this case, the compiler doesn't understand how to inject something with the `Window` token.

Do not refer to ambient types in metadata expressions.

If you must inject an instance of an ambiant type,
you can finesse the problem in four steps:

1. Create an injection token for an instance of the ambiant type.
1. Create a factory function that returns that instance.
1. Add a `useFactory` provider with that factory function.
1. Use `@Inject` to inject the instance.

Here's an illustrative example.

<code-example linenums="false">
// CORRECTED
import { Inject } from '@angular/core';

export const WINDOW = new InjectionToken('Window');
export function _window() { return window; }

@Component({
  ...
  providers: [
    { provide: WINDOW, useFactory: _window }
  ]
})
export class MyComponent {
  constructor (@Inject(WINDOW) private win: Window) { ... }
}
</code-example>

The `Window` type in the constructor is no longer a problem for the compiler because it
uses the `@Inject(WINDOW)` to generate the injection code.

Angular does something similar with the `DOCUMENT` token so you can inject the browser's `document` object (or an abstraction of it, depending upon the platform in which the application runs).

<code-example linenums="false">
import { Inject }   from '@angular/core';
import { DOCUMENT } from '@angular/platform-browser';

@Component({ ... })
export class MyComponent {
  constructor (@Inject(DOCUMENT) private doc: Document) { ... }
}
</code-example>
<hr>

<h3 class="no-toc">Name expected</h3>

The compiler expected a name in an expression it was evaluating.
This can happen if you use a number as a property name as in the following example.

```
// ERROR
provider: [{ provide: Foo, useValue: { 0: 'test' } }]
```

Change the name of the property to something non-numeric.

```
// CORRECTED
provider: [{ provide: Foo, useValue: { '0': 'test' } }]
```

<hr>

<h3 class="no-toc">Unsupported enum member name</h3>

Angular couldn't determine the value of the [enum member](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/enums.html)
that you referenced in metadata.

The compiler can understand simple enum values but not complex values such as those derived from computed properties.

<code-example linenums="false">
// ERROR
enum Colors {
  Red = 1,
  White,
  Blue = "Blue".length // computed
}

  ...
  providers: [
    { provide: BaseColor,   useValue: Colors.White } // ok
    { provide: DangerColor, useValue: Colors.Red }   // ok
    { provide: StrongColor, useValue: Colors.Blue }  // bad
  ]
  ...
</code-example>

Avoid referring to enums with complicated initializers or computed properties.

{@a tagged-template-expressions-not-supported}
<h3 class="no-toc">Tagged template expressions are not supported</h3>

<div class="alert is-helpful">

_Tagged template expressions are not supported in metadata._

</div>

The compiler encountered a JavaScript ES2015 [tagged template expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#Tagged_template_literals) such as,
```
// ERROR
const expression = 'funky';
const raw = String.raw`A tagged template ${expression} string`;
 ...
 template: '<div>' + raw + '</div>'
 ...
```
[`String.raw()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/raw)
is a _tag function_ native to JavaScript ES2015.

The AOT compiler does not support tagged template expressions; avoid them in metadata expressions.

<hr>

<h3 class="no-toc">Symbol reference expected</h3>

The compiler expected a reference to a symbol at the location specified in the error message.

This error can occur if you use an expression in the `extends` clause of a class.
