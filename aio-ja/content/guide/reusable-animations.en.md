# Reusable animations

This topic provides some examples of how to create reusable animations.

## Prerequisites

Before continuing with this topic, you should be familiar with the following:

*   [Introduction to Angular animations](guide/animations)
*   [Transition and triggers](guide/transition-and-triggers)

## Creating reusable animations

To create a reusable animation, use the [`animation()`](api/animations/animation) function to define an animation in a separate `.ts` file and declare this animation definition as a `const` export variable.
You can then import and reuse this animation in any of your application components using the [`useAnimation()`](api/animations/useAnimation) function.

<code-example header="src/app/animations.ts" path="animations/src/app/animations.1.ts" region="animation-const"></code-example>

In the preceding code snippet, `transitionAnimation` is made reusable by declaring it as an export variable.

<div class="alert is-helpful">

**NOTE**: <br />
The `height`, `opacity`, `backgroundColor`, and `time` inputs are replaced during runtime.

</div>

You can also export a part of an animation.
For example, the following snippet exports the animation `trigger`.

<code-example header="src/app/animations.1.ts" path="animations/src/app/animations.1.ts" region="trigger-const"></code-example>

From this point, you can import reusable animation variables in your component class.
For example, the following code snippet imports the `transitionAnimation` variable and uses it via the `useAnimation()` function.

<code-example header="src/app/open-close.component.ts" path="animations/src/app/open-close.component.3.ts" region="reusable"></code-example>
