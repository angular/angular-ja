# Deploying an application

Deploying your application is the process of compiling, or building, your code and hosting the JavaScript, CSS, and HTML on a web server.

This section builds on the previous steps in the [Getting Started](start "Try it: A basic application") tutorial and shows you how to deploy your application.

## Prerequisites

A best practice is to run your project locally before you deploy it. To run your project locally, you need the following installed on your computer:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
* The [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/).
    From the terminal, install the Angular CLI globally with:

    ```sh
    npm install -g @angular/cli
    ```

    With the Angular CLI, you can use the command `ng` to create new workspaces, new projects, serve your application during development, or produce builds to share or distribute.

## Running your application locally

1. Download the source code from your StackBlitz project by clicking the `Download Project` icon in the left menu, across from `Project`, to download your project as a zip archive.

    <div class="lightbox">
      <img src="generated/images/guide/start/download-project.png" alt="Download the stackblitz project">
    </div>

1. Unzip the archive and change directory to the newly created project. For example:

    ```sh
    cd angular-ynqttp
    ```

1. To download and install npm packages, use the following npm CLI command:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

1. Use the following CLI command to run your application locally:

    ```sh
    ng serve
    ```

1. To see your application in the browser, go to http://localhost:4200/.
    If the default port 4200 is not available, you can specify another port with the port flag as in the following example:

     ```sh
    ng serve --port 4201
    ```

    While serving your application, you can edit your code and see the changes update automatically in the browser.
    To stop the `ng serve` command, press `Ctrl`+`c`.

## Building and hosting your application

 1. To build your application for production, use the `build` command. By default, this command uses the `production` build configuration.

    ```sh
    ng build
    ```

    This command creates a `dist` folder in the application root directory with all the files that a hosting service needs for serving your application.

    <div class="alert is-helpful">

    If the above `ng build` command throws an error about missing packages, append the missing dependencies in your local project's `package.json` file to match the one in the downloaded StackBlitz project.

    </div>

1. Copy the contents of the `dist/my-project-name` folder to your web server.
    Because these files are static, you can host them on any web server capable of serving files; such as `Node.js`, Java, .NET, or any backend such as [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting), [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/web-hosting), or [App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/getting-started/hosting-a-static-website).
