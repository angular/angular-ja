@name Missing Iterable Differ
@category runtime
@shortDescription Cannot find a differ for object in ngFor

@description
`NgFor` could not find an iterable differ for the value passed in. Make sure it's an iterable, like an `Array`.

@debugging
When using ngFor in a template, you must use some type of Iterable, like `Array`, `Set`, `Map`, etc.
If you're trying to iterate over the keys in an object, you should look at the [KeyValue pipe](/api/common/KeyValuePipe) instead.
