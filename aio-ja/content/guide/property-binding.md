# Property binding

Property binding in Angular helps you set values for properties of HTML elements or directives.
Use property binding to do things such as toggle button functionality, set paths programmatically, and share values between components.

<div class="alert is-helpful">

See the <live-example></live-example> for a working example containing the code snippets in this guide.

</div>

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of property binding, you should be familiar with the following:

*   [Basics of components](guide/architecture-components)
*   [Basics of templates](guide/glossary#template)
*   [Binding syntax](guide/binding-syntax)

## Understanding the flow of data

Property binding moves a value in one direction, from a component's property into a target element property.

<div class="alert is-helpful">

For more information on listening for events, see [Event binding](guide/event-binding).

</div>

To read a target element property or call one of its methods, see the API reference for [ViewChild](api/core/ViewChild) and [ContentChild](api/core/ContentChild).

## Binding to a property

To bind to an element's property, enclose it in square bracket \(`[]`\) characters, which identifies the property as a target property.
A target property is the DOM property to which you want to assign a value.
For example, the target property in the following code is the image element's `src` property.

<code-example header="src/app/app.component.html" path="property-binding/src/app/app.component.html" region="property-binding"></code-example>

In most cases, the target name is the name of a property, even when it appears to be the name of an attribute.
In this example, `src` is the name of the `<img>` element property.

The square bracket \(`[]`\) characters cause Angular to evaluate the right-hand side of the assignment as a dynamic expression.
Without the brackets, Angular treats the right-hand side as a string literal and sets the property to that static value.

<code-example header="src/app.component.html" path="property-binding/src/app/app.component.html" region="no-evaluation"></code-example>

Omitting the brackets renders the string `parentItem`, not the value of `parentItem`.

## Setting an element property to a component property value

To bind the `src` property of an `<img>` element to a component's property, place the target, `src`, in square brackets followed by an equal sign and then the property.
The property here is `itemImageUrl`.

<code-example header="src/app/app.component.html" path="property-binding/src/app/app.component.html" region="property-binding"></code-example>

Declare the `itemImageUrl` property in the class, in this case `AppComponent`.

<code-example header="src/app/app.component.ts" path="property-binding/src/app/app.component.ts" region="item-image"></code-example>

<a id="colspan"></a>

#### `colspan` and `colSpan`

A common point of confusion is between the attribute, `colspan`, and the property, `colSpan`.
Notice that these two names differ by only a single letter.

If you wrote something like this:

<code-example format="html" language="html">

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan="{{1 + 1}}"&gt;Three-Four&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

</code-example>

You'd get this error:

<code-example format="shell" hideCopy language="shell">

Template parse errors:
Can't bind to 'colspan' because it isn't a known built-in property

</code-example>

As the message says, the `<td>` element does not have a `colspan` property.
This is true because `colspan` is an attribute &mdash;`colSpan`, with a capital `S`, is the corresponding property.
Interpolation and property binding can set only *properties*, not attributes.

Instead, you'd use property binding and write it like this:

<code-example header="src/app/app.component.html" path="attribute-binding/src/app/app.component.html" region="colSpan"></code-example>

Another example is disabling a button when the component says that it `isUnchanged`:

<code-example header="src/app/app.component.html" path="property-binding/src/app/app.component.html" region="disabled-button"></code-example>

Another is setting a property of a directive:

<code-example header="src/app/app.component.html" path="property-binding/src/app/app.component.html" region="class-binding"></code-example>

Yet another is setting the model property of a custom component &mdash;a great way for parent and child components to communicate:

<code-example header="src/app/app.component.html" path="property-binding/src/app/app.component.html" region="model-property-binding"></code-example>

## Toggling button functionality

To disable a button's functionality depending on a Boolean value, bind the DOM `disabled` property to a property in the class that is `true` or `false`.

<code-example header="src/app/app.component.html" path="property-binding/src/app/app.component.html" region="disabled-button"></code-example>

Because the value of the property `isUnchanged` is `true` in the `AppComponent`, Angular disables the button.

<code-example header="src/app/app.component.ts" path="property-binding/src/app/app.component.ts" region="boolean"></code-example>

## Setting a directive property

To set a property of a directive, place the directive within square brackets , such as `[ngClass]`, followed by an equal sign and the property.
Here, the property is `classes`.

<code-example header="src/app/app.component.html" path="property-binding/src/app/app.component.html" region="class-binding"></code-example>

To use the property, you must declare it in the class, which in this example is `AppComponent`.
The value of `classes` is `special`.

<code-example header="src/app/app.component.ts" path="property-binding/src/app/app.component.ts" region="directive-property"></code-example>

Angular applies the class `special` to the `<p>` element so that you can use `special` to apply CSS styles.

## Bind values between components

To set the model property of a custom component, place the target, here `childItem`, between square bracket \(`[]`\) characters followed by an equal sign and the property.
Here, the property is `parentItem`.

<code-example header="src/app/app.component.html" path="property-binding/src/app/app.component.html" region="model-property-binding"></code-example>

To use the target and the property, you must declare them in their respective classes.

Declare the target of `childItem` in its component class, in this case `ItemDetailComponent`.

For example, the following code declares the target of `childItem` in its component class, in this case `ItemDetailComponent`.

Then, the code contains an `@Input()` decorator with the `childItem` property so data can flow into it.

<code-example header="src/app/item-detail/item-detail.component.ts" path="property-binding/src/app/item-detail/item-detail.component.ts" region="input-type"></code-example>

Next, the code declares the property of `parentItem` in its component class, in this case `AppComponent`.
In this example the type of `childItem` is `string`, so `parentItem` needs to be a string.
Here, `parentItem` has the string value of `lamp`.

<code-example header="src/app/app.component.ts" path="property-binding/src/app/app.component.ts" region="parent-data-type"></code-example>

With this configuration, the view of `<app-item-detail>` uses the value of `lamp` for `childItem`.

## Property binding and security

Property binding can help keep content secure.
For example, consider the following malicious content.

<code-example header="src/app/app.component.ts" path="property-binding/src/app/app.component.ts" region="malicious-content"></code-example>

The component template interpolates the content as follows:

<code-example header="src/app/app.component.html" path="property-binding/src/app/app.component.html" region="malicious-interpolated"></code-example>

The browser doesn't process the HTML and instead displays it raw, as follows.

<code-example format="shell" language="shell">

"Template &lt;script&gt;alert("evil never sleeps")&lt;/script&gt; Syntax" is the interpolated evil title.

</code-example>

Angular does not allow HTML with `<script>` tags, neither with [interpolation](guide/interpolation) nor property binding, which prevents the JavaScript from running.

In the following example, however, Angular [sanitizes](guide/security#sanitization-and-security-contexts) the values before displaying them.

<code-example header="src/app/app.component.html" path="property-binding/src/app/app.component.html" region="malicious-content"></code-example>

Interpolation handles the `<script>` tags differently than property binding, but both approaches render the content harmlessly.
The following is the browser output of the sanitized `evilTitle` example.

<code-example format="shell" language="shell">

"Template Syntax" is the property bound evil title.

</code-example>

## Property binding and interpolation

Often [interpolation](guide/interpolation) and property binding can achieve the same results.
The following binding pairs do the same thing.

<code-example header="src/app/app.component.html" path="property-binding/src/app/app.component.html" region="property-binding-interpolation"></code-example>

Use either form when rendering data values as strings, though interpolation is preferable for readability.
However, when setting an element property to a non-string data value, you must use property binding.
