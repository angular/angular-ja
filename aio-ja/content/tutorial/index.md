## Building a template-driven form

[Building a template-driven form](guide/forms) shows you how to create a template-driven form.

The control elements in the form are bound to data properties that have input validation. The input validation helps maintain data integrity and styling to improve the user experience.
Template-driven forms use two-way data binding to update the data model in the component as changes are made in the template and vice versa.
