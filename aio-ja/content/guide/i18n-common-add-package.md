# Add the localize package

To take advantage of the localization features of Angular, use the [Angular CLI][AioCliMain] to add the `@angular/localize` package to your project.

To add the `@angular/localize` package, use the following command to update the `package.json` and `polyfills.ts` files in your project.

<code-example path="i18n/doc-files/commands.sh" region="add-localize"></code-example>

<div class="alert is-helpful">

For more information about `package.json` and `polyfill.ts` files, see [Workspace npm dependencies][AioGuideNpmPackages].

</div>

If `@angular/localize` is not installed and you try to build a localized version of your project, the [Angular CLI][AioCliMain] generates an error.
